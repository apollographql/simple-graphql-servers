A couple very light-weight GraphQL servers that are configuerd to be subgraphs for Apollo Federation.

Deployed to https://simple-graphql-servers.netlify.app/

Every time you deploy, to update the schemas for this graph, run this:
./update-schemas.sh

To debug locally, you can run each script with:

```
node api/subgraph-congress.js
```
